--- &article2

To perform a kinetic evaluation project go through the following steps:
- Check and define preferences (paths to 'R' and 'Working Directory'). To be done only once. Settings are saved for next uses (section 3.1).
-	Set project details: Define trial path and name, specify type of data 
(degradation, water/sediment) (section 3.2)
-	Load data (section 4.3)
-	Set initial values and choose kinetic models (section 5.2)
-	Choose algorithm for evaluation (section 5.2.4)
-	Run evaluation (section 6.5)
-	View results (section 7)


## 3.1  Set R and Working Directory
